What it does:
Use randomly-chosen Wordle words to build a new novel from five open source novels (think Moby Dick, Little Women, etc). 

Until the 'novel' has 50,000 words, it will choose a random word from the list of used Wordle words and find a sentence from a randomly chosen novel (1-5) that contains that word. If there are no sentences in that novel that contain that word, then a different novel is chosen. The sentence is then appended to the 'novel.'

There is no real point, just practicing Python a bit for a fun, silly project. Eventually it would be fun like to use Twitter to chose sentences or words and see where this goes.
